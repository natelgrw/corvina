## Problem 1
{0}From the definition of $O$ we need to show
{0}$\exists n_0 \g 0. \exists c \g 0. \forall n \g n_0. \quad a_n \leq c \cdot 2^n$
{0}Choosing $c = 4$ and $n_0 = 0$, we need to show $a_n \leq 4 \cdot 2^n$ for every $n \geq 0$, which is true by part a).
## Problem 2
## a) 
{0}$(6)(10) = 120$
## b)
{0}$\sqrt{x}$ is irrational.
## Problem 3
{0}$(\exists a, b \in \mathbb{N}. 2015^a + 1 = 16062b) \Rightarrow (\exists a, b \in \mathbb{N}. a = 2b)$
{0}Since $P \Rightarrow$ True is always true, the statement is true.
